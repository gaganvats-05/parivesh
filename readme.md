# PARIVESH (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§¨‡§Ç‡§ß‡§ï)
#### A three tier solution for Bio-Medical Waste Management.






## Inspiration
An assessment by UNEP shows that about 0.5 kg of healthcare waste(HCW) per bed per day is produced in hospitals. While 80% of this waste is potentially harmless but the other 20% can create serious health threats to health workers and communities if not disposed of properly.
#### Need for Prabandhak
 - In current scenario all the HCW is managed by human staff and is prone to human error which could possibly be fatal.
 - Lack of affordable resources creates hinderance for small clinics and hospitals to train its staff for effective healthcare waste management.
 - There is no means of awareness for HCW managment in common household. 


## What It does ?
Parivesh is a three tier solution for the problem of healthcare waste management working on stages from waste production to waste disposal.
#### Stage 1: Production/ Manufacturing
 - Parivesh lets the manufacturers mark their product to classify in type of waste using unique QR codes for having information about the product and its right disposal method.
#### Stage 2 : Training / Awareness
 -  Parivesh lets small clinics and hospital to gain access to staff training modules to ensure better HCW management during usage of such items.
#### Stage 3: Usage / Disposal
 - For products marked by the QR code Parivesh provides the facility of identifying waste as specified by the manufacturers of the product.
 - As a general guide Parivesh also features a ML model to classify the waste into 5 categories based upon the visual appearance of the waste.
 - After classification Parivesh redirects its user towards page containing information about the correct disposal method of the waste.

## How we built it
- Frontend was built upon React and Tailwind-CSS with assests being designed in Spline and Figma.
- Backend was primarly done in NodeJS with database being MongoDB.
- For ML model we used Python and Tensorflow.
- Deployement was done in Render.
## Whats next for Prabandhak

 - implement custom testing modules for hospitals to ensure training of medical staff.
 - extend support from QR codes to BarCodes.
 - implement a Paywall for authentication of manufacturers and hospitals to make the service monitisable.
