# PARIVESH (à¤ªà¤°à¤¿à¤µà¥‡à¤¶)

#### A three tier solution for Bio-Medical Waste Management.

## Inspiration

An assessment by [UNEP](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/8628/IETC_Compendium_Technologies_Treatment_Destruction_Healthcare_Waste.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) shows that about 0.5 kg of healthcare waste(HCW) per bed per day is produced in hospitals. While 80% of this waste is potentially harmless but the other 20% can create serious health threats to health workers and communities if not disposed of properly.

#### Need for Parivesh

- In current scenario all the HCW is managed by human staff and is prone to human error which could possibly be fatal.
- Lack of affordable resources creates hinderance for small clinics and hospitals to train its staff for effective healthcare waste management.
- There is no means of awareness for HCW managment in common household.

## What It does ?

Parivesh is a three tier solution for the problem of healthcare waste management working on stages from waste production to waste disposal.

#### Stage 1: Production/ Manufacturing

- Parivesh lets the manufacturers mark their product to classify in type of waste using unique QR codes for having information about the product and its right disposal method.

#### Stage 2 : Training / Awareness

- Parivesh lets small clinics and hospital to gain access to staff training modules to ensure better HCW management during usage of such items.

#### Stage 3: Usage / Disposal

- For products marked by the QR code Parivesh provides the facility of identifying waste as specified by the manufacturers of the product.
- As a general guide Parivesh also features a ML model to classify the waste into 5 categories based upon the visual appearance of the waste.
- After classification Parivesh redirects its user towards page containing information about the correct disposal method of the waste.

## How we built it

- Frontend was built upon React and Tailwind-CSS with assests being designed in Spline and Figma.
- Backend was primarly done in NodeJS with database being MongoDB.
- For ML model we used Python and Tensorflow.
- Deployement was done in Render.

## Whats next for Parivesh

- implement custom testing modules for hospitals to ensure training of medical staff.
- extend support from QR codes to BarCodes.
- implement a Paywall for authentication of manufacturers and hospitals to make the service monitisable.
